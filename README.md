# Restaurant-Page

A basic page for a restaurant made with HTML, CSS, JS and Webpack.

The page supports navigation to other parts of the page through tab-switching logic.
This project helped me understand better how Webpack bundles your code, and why it is necessary.

This project was created for the [Restaurant Page assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) as part of The Odin Project.
